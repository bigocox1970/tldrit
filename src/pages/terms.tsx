        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing and using TLDRit, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
          TLDRit provides AI-powered text summarization and text-to-speech services. The service processes user-provided content to generate concise summaries and audio versions of text content.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Obligations</h2>
        <p>
          Users agree to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate account information</li>
          <li>Maintain the security of their account</li>
          <li>Use the service in compliance with all applicable laws</li>
          <li>Not attempt to circumvent any service limitations or restrictions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="fair-use-policy">4. Fair Use Policy</h2>
        <p>
          While our Premium plan offers "Unlimited" TLDRs and text-to-speech conversions, this is subject to our fair use policy. This policy exists to ensure the sustainability of our service and fair access for all users.
        </p>
        <h3>Why We Have a Fair Use Policy</h3>
        <p>
          TLDRit relies on advanced AI models and APIs to provide our summarization and text-to-speech services. These underlying services have associated costs that scale with usage. To maintain our affordable pricing while providing high-quality service to all users, we need to ensure that individual usage remains within reasonable bounds.
        </p>
        <h3>Policy Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Premium plan usage is monitored on a monthly basis</li>
          <li>API calls are capped when they exceed the equivalent of Â£10 in API costs for the current month</li>
          <li>This cap helps us prevent potential abuse while ensuring fair access for all users</li>
          <li>The vast majority of users {'(>99%)'} never reach this limit</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>High-Volume Usage</h3>
        <p>
          If you consistently require higher volumes, please contact our support team to discuss enterprise pricing options that better suit your needs.
        </p>

          We are committed to protecting your privacy. All data processing is conducted in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Service Modifications</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
